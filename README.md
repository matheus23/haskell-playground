# haskell playground

This is just a little playground I use when developing small toy projects in haskell. Currently includes two bigger toys:

## Lambda Calculus

A parser / prettyprinter / interpreter / normalizer for the lambda calculus. 

## Propositional Logic

A parser / prettyprinter / tautology checker / equality checker for propositional logic. I used this project to learn about pretty printing, parsing and QuickCheck.
